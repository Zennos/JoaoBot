### Why it is stored?
User informations such as User ID, User discrimator, Text and Message Content are used for the functionality of the command `tag`, the user information is used to to get info of which user is owner of a tag and find tags of specific user. Message Content is also used for the `tag` command, as the content set by the user need to be stored to be used later when using the command again to see the content of a tag.

Emote usage are collected to rank how many times they where used for the command `topemojis`

Guild ID is used to store the guild configuration, such as disabled commands or groups by the command `enable` or `disable`, banned tags, created tags, and also the bot (Jo達oBot) prefix for the specific server.

### How it is stored?
All data stored are secured with password and authentificators by the database [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com).
